# Rubiks Cube
This is an android app for playing with Rubiks cube. It uses OpenGL for drawing and animating the cube. Planned features include:
  - Basic functionalities
    - [x] Rotate the cube as a whole to see the overall state
    - [x] Rotate individual faces (using dedicated buttons)
    - [x] Undo moves
    - [x] Detect if the cube is solved yet
    - [x] Control the cube by touching/swiping on its faces
    - [ ] Publish beta version on Play store
  - Algorithms
    - Add a page to show basic algorithms
    - Apply an algo on the current cube
    - Support user defined algorithms
  - Solve cubes programmatically
    - [x] Solve a scrambled 3x3 cube
    - [ ] Let the user specify the state of a scrambled cube
    - [ ] Read cube colors using the camera
    - [ ] User should be able to trace through the steps
    - [ ] Handle non-standard cubes (deviations from the default color scheme)
    - Higher order cubes use the logic of 3x3 cube. Current solution is not reusable.
  - Bigger cubes like rubik's revenge etc
    - The code support bigger cubes, but needs more testing
    - And I am not familiar with cubes bigger than 4x4 in real life
  - How about skewed puzzles like 3x3x2 etc?
    - Current code does not support them

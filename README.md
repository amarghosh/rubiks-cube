# Rubiks Cube
This is an android app for playing with Rubiks cube and its various derivatives like Rubiks revenge (4x4x4), Professor's cube (5x5x5), and other random permutations like 2x3x4. Main features are listed below. Not that all of these are implemented; some are work in progress and few others are wishlist.
  - Basic functionalities
    - [x] Control the cube by touching/swiping on its faces
    - [x] Rotate the cube as a whole, rotate individual faces
    - [x] Handle cuboid puzzles like 2x3x4, apart from the regular NxNxN cubes
    - [x] Start a new game where cube is scrambled N times
    - [x] Undo moves
    - [x] Detect if the cube is solved yet
    - [x] If user gives up, reveal the solution (retraces the original moves in reverse order)
        - Partially done. User should be able to go through the steps one by one.
    - [ ] Publish beta version on Play store
  - Algorithms
    - [ ] Add a page to show basic algorithms
    - [ ] Apply an algo on the current cube
    - [ ] Support user defined algorithms
  - Solve cubes programmatically
    - [ ] Let the user specify the state of a scrambled cube
    - [x] Solve a scrambled 3x3x3 cube (UI not available as of now)
    - [ ] Read cube colors using the camera!
    - [ ] User should be able to trace through the steps
    - Higher order cubes use the logic of 3x3 cube. Current solution is not reusable.

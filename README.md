# Rubiks Cube
This is an android app for playing with Rubiks cube. It uses OpenGL for drawing and animating the cube. Planned features include:
  - Solving the cube
    - Rotate the cube as a whole to see the overall state
    - Rotate individual faces (using dedicated buttons)
    - Detect if the cube is solved yet
    - Freeze v0.1
  - Control the cube by touching/swiping on its faces
    - Publish beta version on Play store
  - Algorithms
    - Add a page to show basic algorithms
    - Apply an algo on the current cube
    - Support user defined algorithms
  - Solve a scrambled cube programmatically
    - User enters the state of a scrambled cube
    - Handle non-standard cubes (deviations from the default color scheme)
    - App figures out the solution and shows it to him
    - Wishlist: Capture the cube's colors using the camera
  - Bigger cubes like rubik's revenge etc
    - The code is written to support bigger cubes, but needs more testing
    - And I am not familiar with cubes bigger than 4x4 in real life
  - How about skewed puzzles like 3x3x2 etc?
    - Current code does not support them
